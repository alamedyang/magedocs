Set the frame duration (in milliseconds), then double click on the desired tile to add it as a frame to the animation.

If you want an entity to do more complex behaviors when idle, including facing somewhere specific or playing back other kinds of animations once in a while (a sheep that performs a chewing animation twice a second but lowers its head to chomp a fresh mouthful of grass every 15 seconds), consider using an <a href="../scripts/on_tick"><code>on_tick</code></a> script to <a href="../techniques/handlers">handle</a> this instead.</p><p>Entities look far more alive with an idle animation, even if it&#39;s just an occasional blink. Regardless, while the entity need not <em>appear</em> to have an idle animation, the MGE still expects one, so you should define one, even if it&#39;s just the same two frames back-to-back.</p><p>Idle animations are expected to loop seamlessly.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Best Practice</p><p>To avoid robotic synchronization between entities, try to stagger their animation timings by setting the <code>current_frame</code> property for that entity on their Tiled map or via <a href="../actions/SET_ENTITY_CURRENT_FRAME">SET_ENTITY_CURRENT_FRAME</a> inside a <a href="../scripts">script</a>.</p></div><h3 id="walking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#walking" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Walking</h3><p>This animation plays when entities move within the game.

It can also be deliberately triggered for arbitrary character entities via a script.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Best Practice</p><p>The engine uses the modulo of the animation index for playback, so if there is no action animation defined, likely the idle animation will play instead. If the idle animation is quite long, this means the entity will be frozen in place, doing apparently nothing, for some time. (For the player character, this also prevents the player from moving or doing anything else until the animation is finished.) Therefore, it&#39;s best to provide an action animation, even if there aren&#39;t sprite tiles prepared specifically for an action animation. Our recommendation is to copy the fidget portion of the idle and to keep it brief.</p></div><p>Action animations are not expected to loop.
