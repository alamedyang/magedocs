Three entities having a race would instead run the entire course one at a time, each waiting patiently for the runner before them to complete their route. And indeed, if one of the simultaneous behaviors has no stopping point, the actions listed afterwards will never execute at all.</p><p>The simultaneous behaviors must be managed by <code>on_tick</code> slots because <a href="../script_slots#on-interact"><code>on_interact</code></a> and <a href="../script_slots#on-load"><code>on_load</code></a> script slots cannot execute actions at arbitrary times.</p><p>When the simultaneous behaviors are finished, however, the <code>on_tick</code> slots must be then set to something else or the new behavior will loop indefinitely (unless that&#39;s what you want).
