This is necessary if testing new engine features or if you are updating your badge from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2.

Instead, you will need to have a JTAG Programmer, and will need to know how to use it. Please contact the DC801 Black Mage Badge game team if you want help updating a purple badge.</p></div><p>To start the game in bootloader mode, hold down the hex digit <code>1</code> button while you power on the hardware. If bootloader mode was successfully triggered, the screen will be white and the LEDs will blink in a circular pattern.</p><p>If the hardware is plugged into a computer while it is in bootloader mode, it will appear as a drive called <code>DC801BOOT</code> or <code>NRF52BOOT</code>. Copy the new game engine UF2 (the filename doesn&#39;t matter) onto the drive.</p><p>Once the UF2 is copied, the drive will disconnect. If the badge does not restart automatically at this point, you may restart it now.</p><h3 id="tips" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tips" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tips</h3><ul><li>Plug into the badge on the USB-C port. This port is on the front, on the upper right side, near the capacitive button that looks like a hat. Do not use the micro USB port (available on some back plates) as this is for programming the lights.</li><li>If the copy seems to be taking a long time (more than 2 minutes) or appears to suffer from other kinds of I/O problem, try using a different USB-C cable.</li><li>Macs with Apple Silicon may display an error message when the drive unmounts, like <code>The operation can’t be completed because the device disappeared</code> or <code>The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “bm_badge.uf2” can’t be read or written. Error code -36</code> You may ignore these.</li></ul><h2 id="game-dat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#game-dat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>game.dat</code></h2><p>To install new scenario data on the hardware, prepare a microSD card (FAT32) with a folder called <code>MAGE</code> in the root directory. Copy the new <code>game.dat</code> into <code>MAGE/</code>, then insert the card into the slot on the hardware. (The microSD card slot is on the top of the badge, opposite the USB-C port.)</p><p>If the hardware determines its <code>game.dat</code> is different from the one on the microSD card (or if you hold <code>MEM3</code> when turning on the badge), you will see:</p><div class="language-text" data-ext="text"><pre class="shiki dark-plus" style="background-color:#1E1E1E;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#D4D4D4;">The file \`game.dat\` on your SD card does not match</span></span>
