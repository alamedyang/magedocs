# Terminal

The terminal interface, new in the chapter 2 version of the Mage Game Engine (MGE), allows a computer to connect to the badge over USB and use it as a serial host. (The [[web_build|web build]] instead uses a terminal emulator right in the web browser window.)

Some serial [[commands|commands]] are build in to the MGE by default, but others must be registered.

[[scripts|Scripts]] can print serial messages with [[serial_dialogs|serial dialogs]]. These can listen for specific serial input, too, with [[serial_dialogs#Serial Dialog Option|serial dialog options]].
