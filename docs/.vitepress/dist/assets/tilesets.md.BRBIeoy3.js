Semi-transparent pixels are assigned by the encoder to be either fully opaque or fully transparent at a 50% threshold.</p><p>To encode alpha, the MGE repurposes the least-significant green bit in the RGB565 color encoding scheme. Because of this, the color 0x0200 (hex #004000, or rgb 0,64,0) will actually manifest as transparent within the MGE. Avoid using this color (or any color that becomes 0x0200 when converted to RGB565).</p><h3 id="pallet" tabindex="-1">Pallet <a class="header-anchor" href="#pallet" aria-label="Permalink to “Pallet”">​</a></h3><p>The <a href="./encoder.html">encoder</a> indexes the pallets of each image, and there is therefore a <strong>maximum of 255 colors per tileset image</strong> (excluding transparency, which is always included, making it 256 colors total). The encoder will let you know if one of your tilesets is over the color limit.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title custom-block-title-default">TIP</p><p>If you&#39;re having trouble keeping your pallets under control, consider using the PNG-8 and GIF file formats, as they cannot contain more than 256 colors. Just remember that at least one of these colors must be transparent!</p></div><p>If you need extra colors, consider splitting the tileset into multiple files — maps will quite happily use tiles from multiple tilesets with no trouble, provided the tiles are of uniform size.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Best Practice</p><p>On embedded, pixel data is streamed from the ROM chip, but the tileset pallets must be held in RAM. Because RAM is very, very precious, <strong>please combine tilesets if there isn&#39;t a compelling reason to keep them in separate files</strong>. Entity sprite sheets are typically kept separate, for instance, but you might combine spritesheets for similar entities, or combine all character entity portraits. (And naturally, tilesets with differing tile sizes must be separate!)</p></div><h3 id="updating-tileset-images-on-the-fly" tabindex="-1">Updating Tileset Images on the Fly <a class="header-anchor" href="#updating-tileset-images-on-the-fly" aria-label="Permalink to “Updating Tileset Images on the Fly”">​</a></h3><p>When you save changes to an image that Tiled is actively using, including changing its dimensions, the graphical changes are instantly reflected in all maps, tilesets, etc. within Tiled. This way, you can rapidly iterate on how something looks.</p><p>However, changes in image dimensions are <em>not</em> automatically perpetuated to the tileset&#39;s declared properties, and since the <a href="./encoder.html">encoder</a> relies on those values to determine the tileset&#39;s size, this will cause problems: for tiles past the tileset&#39;s declared bounds, the pixel data will behave correctly, but random <a href="./tilesets.html#tile-collisions">tile collisions</a> will be applied.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Make any change whatsoever to the tileset inside of Tiled to have it recalculate those properties, then save.
