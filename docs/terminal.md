# Terminal

The terminal interface, new in the chapter 2 version of the Mage Game Engine (MGE), allows a computer to connect to the badge over USB and use it as a serial host. (The [web build](web_build) instead uses a terminal emulator right in the web browser window.)

Some serial [commands](commands) are build in to the MGE by default, but others must be registered.

[Scripts](scripts) can print serial messages with [serial dialogs](serial_dialogs). These can listen for specific serial input, too, with [serial dialog options](serial_dialogs#serial-dialog-option).
